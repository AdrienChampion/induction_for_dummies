# TODO

- most chapters end with little to no explicit connective tissue with the next chapter

- change *chapters* to *posts* throughout

- mention BMC always finds the shortest cex by design

- update intro and mikino's first chapter once it is public

- add a chapter discussing the technicalities of SMT solvers

	- NP-complete ⇒ do whatever we can to simplify the checks

	- they learn stuff ⇒ incremental checks maintaining the instances

	- never use `push`/`pop`

- update BMC section to justify using activation literals by referring to the SMT solvers
  technicalities chapter
